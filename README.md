## datasets

this project uses the [Fresh and Stale Images of Fruits and Vegetables dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raghavrpotdar/fresh-and-stale-images-of-fruits-and-vegetables/data)
and the [Spoiled and fresh fruit inspection dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/6ps7gtp2wg/1)

To get the same structure we used, run:
create_binary_set.py from the script folder
